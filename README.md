I'm Robynn Powell, a technical writer with a focus on user experience (UX), content management, information architecture, and content development.

What is a technical writer? We hear this question a lot. Job titles vary and change. A few are technical writer, information developer, content strategist, technical communicator, technical editor, UX writer. 

The title UX writer is fairly new in the field of technical communication, though the tasks involved are not. Technical writers and technical editors have always worked hard to exceed and enhance user expectations with the product and the documentation. Our efforts add value to the team effort. Clear and concise content is critical in user guides, and it's also key to excellent product messages, interface text, and embedded user assistance. 

Regardless of title, the business function of the role involves more than writing processes for software manuals. We function as detectives, librarians, silo-breakers, UX consultants, information architects, interviewers, content curators, and content strategists. 

We develop *quality content* for consumers of information in multiple media like websites, blogs, marketing collateral, tutorials, training materials, and more. So, what is *quality content*? Authors of *Developing Quality Technical Information: A Handbook for Writers and Editors* define it like this: 

| Easy to use | Easy to understand | Easy to find | 
| ----------- | :----------------- | :----------- |
|- Task oriented | - Clear       | - Well organized |
|- Accurate | - Concrete | - Retrievable |
|- Complete |- Consistently styled | - Visually effective |
